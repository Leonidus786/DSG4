    "# Well, first let's change these print statements. Instead of giving them the bill at each of these steps,\n",
    "# I'm going to tell them which type of ticket they're eligible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So the next thing to do is to ask them whether if they want a photo or not.\n",
    "# So I'm going to need to use an input, but the question is where do I put that?\n",
    "# Now the correct answer is that it has to be at the same indentation level as this age if block is. So you can imagine this whole thing with the,\n",
    "# if elif and else as sort of belonging together. \n",
    "# Because they all relate to one thing: what is their age and which type of ticket are they eligible for.\n",
    "# Now, outside of that if statement, I'm going to create an input and ask the user, do you want a photo taken? Type Y for yes or N for no.\n",
    "# And then I'm going to save their input inside a variable called wants_photo.\n",
    "# So now I'm going to use an if statement to check what their answer was. If it was true, then I'm going to add $3 and if it was false,\n",
    "# I'm just going to skip to giving them their ticket price.\n",
    "# So here is where I write my if statement. Notice how it's at the same indentation level as this previous set of if statements.\n",
    "# But it's not at the same indentation level as this set of if statement. So essentially what's happening is once I've checked their age,\n",
    "# then I'm going to check whether if they want a photo or not. And this is going to apply to everybody no matter their age.\n",
    "# So if wants_photo is equal to Y, well in this case I'm going to go and add $3 to their bill.\n",
    "# But how can I add $3 the bill when I don't have a variable to vary?\n",
    "# So instead of using these print statements, I'm going to create a variable up here called bill and I'm going to set it to equal zero.\n",
    "# Now in addition to printing to the user how much their ticket is, I'm going to set the bill to the price that they're supposed to pay.\n",
    "# So if age is less than 12 bill is equal to $5, if age is less than 18 then the bill is equal to $7, and finally for everybody else, he bill is equal to $12. \n",
    "# So now depending on these conditions, the variable bill is going to be changed to a different number.\n",
    "# But once we land in this if statement, I'm going to have to add $3 to their bill no matter which value it is at the moment.\n",
    "# So effectively, what I want to do is bill equals the current value of bill plus $3. So if bill was $7,\n",
    "# then this new value bill should be $10. If bill was $12 then it should now be $15.\n",
    "# Now in Python as well as many other languages, there's actually a slightly shorter way of writing this(bill = bill + 3).\n",
    "# When you want to increase the current value that's held in a variable and you wanna save it back into the variable,\n",
    "# you can simply write plus equals. So bill += 3 is the same as bill = bill + 3.\n",
    "# Now, no matter what the value of bill is before it reached this if statement, I'm still going to add $3 to it. Now after this\n",
    "# Now after this if statement is completed, I don't actually have to write a companion else statement because in this case,\n",
    "# if the answer is no, then we're simply going to do nothing. We're not going to do anything to the bill. Instead,\n",
    "# I'm just going to skip ahead and print to the user their final bill.\n",
    "# And I'm going to use fstrings to insert the value that the bill variable has into this print statement. Now for your code to work,\n",
    "# the indentation matters a huge deal because the computer will think you want it to do different things depending on the indentation.\n",
    "# So notice how this indentation shows that this bill plus three is to be executed when this (wants_photo == \"Y\")condition is true,\n",
    "# but this print(print(\"Your final bill is {bill}\")) statement is not indented to the same level and effectively it's going to \n",
    "# happen after this (if wants_photo == \"Y\":) if statement has been executed. \n",
    "# So you can play around with indenting this print statements, un-indenting it and see what the difference is.\n",
