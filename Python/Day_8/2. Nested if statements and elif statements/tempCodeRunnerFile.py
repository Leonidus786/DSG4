print("Welcome to rollercoaster!")

# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# if height >= 120:
#     print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
#     # Now the first thing I'm going to check is if the age is less than 12. Under this condition, they should pay $5. So let's change that to five.

#     if age < 12:
#         print("Please pay $5.")
#     # Now the next condition should be created using an elif, which stands for else if. So it means, if above condition is not true else if, can you check if this is true?
#     # Well in that case then we should do this. For example, if the age is not less than 12, so they're over 12, then are they under 18? 
#     # Well then this condition basically catches everybody who's between 12 and 18. 
#     elif age <= 18:
#         print("Please pay $7.")
#     # And finally, if they're not less than or equal to 18 and they're not less than 12 then that's everybody else who is over 18.

#     else:
#         print("Please pay $12.")
# else:
#     print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
