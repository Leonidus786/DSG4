# All right, congratulations! You've got yourself a job at Python Pizza.
# So your first job as a programmer at Python Pizza is to build an automatic Pizza Order Program.
# That is the goal of this exercise.
# Take a look at the starting code.
# You'll see that the user can put in the size that they want, whether if they want to add pepperoni and whether if they want extra cheese.
# Based on the user input for these three criteria, we're going to work out what is the price of their pizza.
# If you look inside the pdf file you'll see the different modifiers. Starting with the size, we have different prices for small, medium, and large.
# And then if somebody wants to add pepperoni that's an extra $2 to a small pizza, $3 for a medium or large pizza. And finally, if you want to add extra cheese for any pizza that's just a single extra dollar. If you take a look at the example input where we've got a large pizza where they want "Yes" to pepperoni and "No" to extra cheese, then the example output is as follows. "Thank you for choosing Python Pizza Deliveries! Your final bill is: $28."
# Now remember, the first line of that output is already printed for you in line 1, so you don't need to worry about that. All you need to figure out is how to build the program so that it prints out, "Your final bill is", and then calculates the correct value based on the user input.
# And the user input is just going to be a bunch of letters. So the first input is going to come in for the size, S, M or L. The second one is going to be Y or N, and the third one is also going be Y or N.
# Have a think about this, apply your knowledge of conditionals, and see if you can complete this exercise.
