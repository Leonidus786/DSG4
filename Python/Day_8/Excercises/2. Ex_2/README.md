# In this exercise, we're going to write some code to upgrade the previous version of our BMI calculator.
# So this is our BMI calculator 2.0, if you will.
# Now, we're going to write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index instead of just simply printing out what it is, because for most people, these numbers don't really mean anything.
# If you take a look in the task pdf, you'll see that there is a chart that shows how different BMI are classified by doctors.
# If you are within the green band, so if your BMI is between 18.5 and 25, then that is considered the normal weight.
# And depending on which band you are in, then there are different classifications that doctors have come up with.
# What we're going to do is we're going to take a user's height and weight, we're going to calculate the BMI, and we're going to output a print statement telling them, "Your BMI is X...", whatever it is we calculated, and then we're going to give them an interpretation.
# You are underweight or you have a normal weight, and you can check in the task pdf for exactly what your output needs to match.
# Now, I know people are a little bit sensitive about these topics, and there are certain statements, like you are obese or you are slightly overweight, that can be difficult, but just know that these are words that have come from the clinical interpretations of the BMI and we are just going to output them from our calculator.
# Take a look at some of the Example Inputs and Example Outputs and see what it is that you are expected to create. And then see if you can remember how to create the BMI calculator second time round and add in a slight interpretation like the ones you see in the task pdf.
# Have a go at this coding exercise.
