# Now the goal of this exercise is to write a program using what you've learned about if and else conditional statements to figure out whether if an input number is odd or even.

# So what differentiates odd and even numbers?
# Well, even numbers, by definition, can be divided by two with no remainder.
# That means that the final result has no decimal places. It's a whole number and the division is clean.
# Whereas if you took an odd number, like three, and divided it by two, the result is 1.5, and it does have a decimal place. It's not a whole number.
# In Python and in many other programming languages, there's a way to check if a division occurs with no remainder, and that is through something called the modulo.
# Now, you can use the modulo by writing a percentage sign % and that will give you the remainder after a division.
# For example, if you divide six by two, that equals three with no remainder.
# So if 6 % 2, the result would be 0.
# But if you try to divide five by two, then two can go into five two times, but there is one remainder.
# So five modulo two is equal to one (5 % 2 = 1).
# You can take a look in the description pane to see this written out and understand how the modulo works
# and you can get more details on the modulo by Googling for it as well.

# In our case, we want our code to be able to check the input number and it's ready coming in, and we're converting it into a whole number.
# And we're going to check to see if it's odd, or even. If it's odd, we're going to print into the output, "This is an odd number."
# And if it's even, we're going to print, "This is an even number."
# That is the task at hand, and now it's for you to start struggling and trying to figure out how to solve this code exercise.
