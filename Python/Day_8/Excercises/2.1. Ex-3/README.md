# This code exercise is a difficult one, and you can see that in the description box.
# I've marked it out as a difficult challenge. The goal of this exercise is for you to build,
# a program that checks when given any year, whether if that year is a leap year.
# A leap year has 366 days instead of the usual 365 with an extra day in February and it's actually kind of interesting, the reason behind why we need a leap year.
# And here you'll see a link to a video that actually explains to you the full reasoning behind it and it's really, really fascinating. So take a look if you're interested. -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE

# In order to work out whether if a year is a leap year, there is a logic to it and it's expressed like this.
# So you take a particular year and it is a leap year if it can be divisible by four with no remainder, except if that year is also divisible by 100 with no remainder, and unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder.
# So there's actually three steps that we need to take, our year through. And it's because these criteria flip whether if a year is leap year or not leap year.
# If you take a look at the example in the task pdf and see how I've worked through various years, like year 2000 or year 2100 and how I've applied these rules into maths to show you which one is leap and which one's not leap and the logic behind it. What I recommend doing is to try it out yourself with pen and paper before you write any code, just pick a random year out of the top of your head and work through these three rules and figure out whether if it's a leap year or not a leap year, and then just type into Google that year and check is this a leap year? 
# That's probably the easiest way to just wrap your head around these three rules.
