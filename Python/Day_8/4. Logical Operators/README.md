# Now up to this point, you've seen us use if statements, else statements, elif statements, multiple if statements as well as nested if statements.
# But the thing that we haven't been able to do thus far is to check for multiple conditions in the same line of code.
# if condition_1 & condition_2 & condition_3:
    do this
# else:
    do this

# So how would we be able to combine different conditions and say, well, is the pizza large and the user wants pepperoni and extra cheese all in the same line of code? Well, to do this we would need to learn about the logical operators.

# Logical Operators
# A and B
# C or D
# not E

# So there's three of them that are really useful: and, or and not.

# So let's take a look at the first one.
# When you combine two different conditions using an and operator, they both have to be true, both A and B for the entire line of code to be true. If just one of them is true, say A is true and B is false, or A is false and B is true, then the overall thing evaluates to false. See main.py file
